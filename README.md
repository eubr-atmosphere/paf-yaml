# Privacy Assessment Forms official YAMLs

Privacy Assessment Forms (PAF) is a tool that applies the GDPR (General Data Privacy Regulation, Europe) and LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, Brazil) legislations to a dataset.

This repo contains the recipes needed to deploy PAF using Kubernetes (privacy-assessment-forms.yaml) or Docker Compose (docker-compose-production.yml).
